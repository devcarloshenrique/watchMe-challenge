This will be an application where your main objective is to refactor a page to list movies according to genre. The purpose of this refactoring is to practice the concept of **componentization**.

The application is already fully functional, but most of its code is directly in the `App.tsx.` file. To solve this in the best way, it is necessary to divide the application into at least two main parts: **sidebar** and **content** which has the header and movie listing.
